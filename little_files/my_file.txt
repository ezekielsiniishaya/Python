File handling in Python is pretty straightforward
I can create, write to and even delete any file I want
All I have to do is 
	1. use the open() function
	2. More about this in the future.
As I was saying earlier about file handling in Python.
	3. Chose to either open the file for reading, writing, appending or a combination of any
	4. Use the goodies that come with the open() function like readline() and write() functions.
